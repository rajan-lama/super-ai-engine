Believe in Democratize AI with WordPress. Your site can now chat, write poetry, solve problems, and maybe make you coffee.

== Description ==

**Super AI Engine connects WordPress with AI models.** Build intelligent chatbots, generate content, create AI forms, and automate tasks. All from your WordPress dashboard.

Please make sure you read the [disclaimer](https://rithemes.com/super-ai-engine/disclaimer/). For more information, check the official website of [Super AI Engine](https://rithemes.com/wordpress-plugins/super-ai-engine/).

== Quick Intro ==

Hello! ☀️ I built Super AI Engine to bring Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, and other AI models into WordPress. Create chatbots that understand your content, generate posts in your voice, translate instantly, create images, or build custom AI tools.

For developers: internal APIs, REST endpoints, function calling, and MCP support. Build AI features, automate workflows, or create SaaS applications on WordPress.

Feeling overwhelmed? 🤪 Start simple: Create a chatbot. Then connect ChatGPT through MCP, giving AI direct access to your site. You can even connect Super AI Engine to multiple WordPress sites and manage them all through conversation.

You'll be having a blast before you've explored everything.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why am I getting "Error 429: You exceeded your current quota"? =

This error comes from OpenAI's API, not Super AI Engine. Set up billing limits in your [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing). Caching plugins can sometimes store error responses, so [clear your caches](https://ai.thehiddendocs.com/common-issues/exceeded-current-quota/) too.

= Who is Super AI Engine for, and how do I manage usage limits? =

Super AI Engine can be used by site owners, administrators, and visitors via chat widgets. To set query limits and prevent unlimited model runs, follow the [Managing Limits guide](https://ai.thehiddendocs.com/limits/).

= Does the chatbot support my language? =

AI models support many languages, but quality varies. There's no definitive list since models are constantly updated. [Test your language](https://ai.thehiddendocs.com/faq/does-it-support-my-language) in the AI Playground.

= How does MCP work, and what can I do with it? =

MCP (Model Context Protocol) exposes WordPress tools to AI agents. [Learn how to enable the SSE endpoint](https://ai.thehiddendocs.com/mcp/), choose which tools to expose, and secure them. You can manage posts, comments, users, media, and more.

= Can I restrict the chatbot to answer only from my site content? =

You can't completely block the model's built-in knowledge, but you can [use smart prompts and embeddings](https://ai.thehiddendocs.com/restrict-chatbot-topics/) to steer conversations toward your content.

= The chatbot doesn't appear or looks odd on my site =

Check the [Common Issues guide](https://ai.thehiddendocs.com/common-issues/) for solutions to REST API problems, caching conflicts, nonce errors, and layout glitches.

= Where can I learn the basics and troubleshoot problems? =

Start with the [Basics guide](https://ai.thehiddendocs.com/basics/) for installation and key concepts. For specific issues, check [Common Issues](https://ai.thehiddendocs.com/common-issues/).

= How do I report security issues? =

Report security vulnerabilities through the [Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/9e5fbbbc-964a-4204-8bc0-198f21284efd).
